# REST-API-RecipeApp

## Description
Recipe API is a robust backend REST API designed specifically for a recipe management application. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities, including user registration and authentication, recipe and ingredient management, tagging, image uploads, object filtering, search capabilities, and more.

The Django admin interface is also customized to align with the unique requirements of the recipe management application, providing an intuitive and tailored administrative interface. Additionally, a Postgres database was configured to ensure seamless data management, leveraging the scalability and robustness of a relational database structure.

The API was developed using the Django Rest Framework, with a strong focus on Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, and set up to run within Docker containers for ease of management and deployment.
